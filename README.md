## shoal-model-in-R
I'm more comfortable with plotting using [ggplot2][gg] in R, so this repository is for all of the data that I export from the original fish shoaling model, created in Python and housed in [fish-shoaling-model][model].

The repository also includes a script for importing data from [LoggerPro][lp], which I use to track fish in video.
